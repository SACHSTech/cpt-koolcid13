## Description of Dataset:

### The dataset used in this visualization reflects suicide rates over various age ranges and years in the past decade. The implemented charts are representative of how suicide rates tend to be higher among older individuals. Based on the charts from this dataset, global suicide rates are  highest in people aged 70 years and older. Moreover, it can be observed how suicides globally follow a standard pattern of the older the age group, the higher the death rate.

## Why this topic and dataset:
### Whether the victim is seven or seventy, suicide has always been tragic to even hear about. Personally, suicide is one of the few things that truly shatters my heart and forces me to act and help in some way. I thought visualizing a dataset regarding suicide rates among different age groups would be an effective way to bring awareness to newer generations or anyone not already educated on the topic.
